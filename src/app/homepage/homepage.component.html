    <p>This is a fun application with a question form and some statistics.</p>
    <p>It does not do a lot - rather, you answer a few elementary questions in the <a appHighlight routerLink="/questionnaire" class="underline">Questionnaire</a> section about your movie preferences and then your responses are being added to the sample of people who have done the same.</p>
    <p>In the <a appHighlight routerLink="/records" class="underline">Statistics</a> section you can see some charts that present the aggregated data based on the number of submitted questionnaires at the time.</p>
    <h3 class="why">Why? ðŸ˜³</h3>
    <p>A couple of months ago I started a new job and had to learn <span class="gradient-text">Angular</span> among other things.</p>
    <p>Being used in <span class="gradient-text">React</span> for quite some time, I was dreading the transition.</p>
    <p>I find building mock applications the most effective way for me to learn new technologies, and this is what I am doing here :)</p>
    <p>This app is made with <span class="gradient-text">Angular</span> and <span class="gradient-text">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</span>.</p>
    <p>I use <span class="gradient-text">DynamoDB</span> to store the questionnaire records and <span class="gradient-text">Lambda</span> with <span class="gradient-text">API Gateway</span> for creating the endpoints that I use in the frontend to communicate with my database.</p>
